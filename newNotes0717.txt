New updates for today's demo

Changed from gpiozero to pigpio.

Setting up pigpio as a daemon in the background to use its own separate process:
	sudo pigpiod

Had to put everything in the same file so I could use global variables. 
Three different files was not working with imports.
Now I can have a global array with the x and y locations of faces found.
I use the first face in the array so it doesnt catch other weird ones in the background.
